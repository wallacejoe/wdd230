            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Athlete</h3>
            <p>A college track athlete is in track season; this means he needs to be very
                selective with his diet, and eat only good foods. Our site can provide him
                with a list of good, healthy, ready to go fruit salads and smoothies. In
                addition, he can customize his order according to his personal preference,
                ensuring he gets exaclty what he's looking for.
            </p>
            <h3>Stay at Home Mom</h3>
            <p>This stay at home mom is finding it challenging to ensure her kids are getting
                well balanced meals. To help solve this problem, she decides to supplement
                there usual meals with fruits and produce from our company. Because she's busy
                taking care of kids, she doesn't really have the time to physically go and get
                the food. Our site fixes this problem by allowing her to place, and customize
                her order, all without leaving home.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Developer</h3>
            <p>A web developer has found that his diet has declined, as has his excercise. To
                get back in shape he decides to start eating healthier and working out. To help
                him accomplish this goal, our site can provide him with both healthy meal options,
                but it can also provide ready to go options perfect for a workout session.
            </p>
            <h3>College Kid</h3>
            <p>This individual is not particularly interested in sports. He does not feel any particular
                drive to eat healthier. He does however, want to add some variety to his diet. As
                a result, he turns to us in order to get good food, that is different from the food
                he usually eats.
